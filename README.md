# VC-css_snippets
# These Css Snippets where built to work with Vencord, so iam unsure if they will work with other client mods

Important - 
1. Fixed Code/Learned new skill icons are now recolored on both the channel lists and on top of the chat
2. As per a request 'NSFW' Label now appears that top of chat
3. There is no icon diff for a stage marked 'NSFW' on desktop so those arnt labeled *(until i find a way to label them)*
4. People have been asking for this on Vendetta/Pyoncord(Bunny) and for those people id like to point you too [NexxUtils](https://bunny.nexpid.xyz/nexxutils/)
- About Enmity
I dont know about nor do i care about Enmity *(If you do and this exist for it feel free to open a issue an tell me then ill add it here
